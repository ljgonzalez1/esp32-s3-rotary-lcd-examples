## esp32-s3-rotary-lcd-examples

### ðŸ§­ Overview

**This repository will host simple, beginner-friendly examples for the ESP32â€‘S3 with a round touchscreen LCD and a rotary encoder. Each example is isolated so you can build and upload it on its own. Start small, confirm the hardware works, and then add features step by step.**

### ðŸ§ª Examples

* `example-01-red-screen`: minimal project that initializes the board and turns the screen background solid red. Also prints basic status over the serial monitor.
