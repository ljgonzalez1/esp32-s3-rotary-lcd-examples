### ðŸ§­ Overview

This repository contains simple, beginner-friendly examples for the ESP32â€‘S3 with a round touchscreen LCD and a rotary encoder. Each example is independent so you can build and upload it on its own. Start with the basics, confirm the hardware works, and then add features step by step.

### ðŸ§ª Examples

* `example-01-red-screen`: minimal project that initializes the board and sets the screen background to solid red. Also prints basic status over the serial monitor.

---

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `example-01-red-screen` folder in your preferred development setup.
3. Build and upload to your ESP32â€‘S3.
4. Open a serial monitor at **115200 baud** to view logs.
